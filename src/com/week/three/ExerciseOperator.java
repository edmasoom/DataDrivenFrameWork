//income bracket = between 80-120k approval rate is 95%
//State of California
//income * 5 = 100k *5 : 500K
//the outcome of this program should be like this
//Bracket A: 650 And 60k-80k approved for 300K
//Bracket B: 650-700 and 80k-120k approved for 500K
//Bracket C: 650 and income is 120k approved for 400k
//bracket D: less than 650 and his income is less than 60k
//bracket E: in none of above criteria
//5 min to think about a good block code to give you proper result
